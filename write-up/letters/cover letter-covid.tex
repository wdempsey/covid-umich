\opening{Dear Dr. Zhu:}

Kindly find enclosed the revised version of the manuscript number AOAS2006-048 titled ``Statistical paradoxes in coronavirus case-counts: selection bias, measurement error, and the COVID-19 pandemic'' now titled ``Addressing selection bias and measurement error in COVID-19 case count data using auxiliary information.''  We have revised the article to address the refereesâ€™ requests about exposition and other points of clarification.  The reports called for a major revision to make the manuscript ``forward compatible'', to re-structure the manuscript to present figures and tables near their corresponding discussion, to discuss potential non-response bias in the motivating studies, to include a more careful discussion of COVID-19 testing and disease dynamics, to include a more precise definition of the active infection rate and how it impacts model-based estimation, and to more carefully tie the proposal to related parts of the epidemiological literature. The new version complies with these requests.

We believe the work presents an important advance in how researchers should think about addressing time-varying selection bias and measurement error to better understanding the COVID-19 pandemic trajectory. Attached please find a detailed response to the referees outlining how the changes to the manuscript address the concerns raised in their reports.

Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to hearing back from you.

\closing{Sincerely,}


\end{letter}
