\opening{Dear Dr. Zhu:}

Kindly find enclosed the revised version of the manuscript number AOAS2006-048 titled ``Addressing selection bias and measurement error in COVID-19 case count data using auxiliary information.''  We are happy that the two reviewers, associate editor, and editor have all found the revision much improved. We have revised the article to address the few remaining concerns that one of the reviewers raised but are glad that they ``appreciate the paper and [are] very supportive of the pragmatic approach.''  We have edited the remark, performed a sensitivy analysis to assess sensitivity due to potential confounding, and adjusted the figures to assist in comprehension.

We continue to believe the work presents an important advance in how researchers should think about addressing time-varying selection bias and measurement error to better understanding the COVID-19 pandemic trajectory. Attached please find a detailed response to the referee outlining how the changes to the manuscript address the concerns raised in their report.

Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to hearing back from you.

\closing{Sincerely,}


\end{letter}
