\opening{Dear Dr. Zhu:}

Kindly find enclosed the revised version of the manuscript number AOAS2006-048 titled ``Addressing selection bias and measurement error in COVID-19 case count data using auxiliary information.''  We are happy that the revised manuscript was found to address the remaining concerns raised by the reviewers. At the Editor's request, we have shortened the article to 26 pages without references and included 5 figures.  The main paper still retains all of the main points while the supplement contains important but secondary analyses and discussions that were removed from the main paper in this editing process.

We continue to believe the work presents an important advance in how researchers should think about addressing time-varying selection bias and measurement error to better understanding the COVID-19 pandemic trajectory.

Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to hearing back from you.

\closing{Sincerely,}


\end{letter}
