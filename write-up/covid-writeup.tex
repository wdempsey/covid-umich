\begin{abstract}
  Coronavirus case-counts have influenced governments on their policies and decision making, while researchers have used them to drive their forecast models and predictions. Throughout this, many have also cited limited testing as the key driver of weak information on the COVID-19 pandemic. The calls to increase testing capacity are well-justified as they become a more frequent point of discussion in the public sphere. While expanded testing is a laudable goal, selection bias will impact estimates of disease prevalence and the effective reproduction number until the entire population is sampled. Moreover, tests are imperfect as false positive/negative rates interact in complex ways with selection bias. Indeed, measurement error and selection bias are the two greatest problems limiting our understanding of the current COVID-19 pandemic; neither can be fully addressed by increased testing capacity. In this paper, we attempt to clarify this point. Through simple calculations, we demonstrate pitfalls and paradoxes that can arise when considering case-count data in the presence of selection bias and measurement error.

\section{Introduction}
The World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a public health emergency.  As of June 2nd, 2020, over 6 million cases have been confirmed worldwide with 1.8 million cases and over 100 thousand confirmed deaths across the United States. This pandemic
has become the focal point of everyday life; yet the data landscape for understanding COVID-19 remains limited.  Public databases~\cite{JHU_Lancet,NYT} provide incoming county-level information of confirmed cases and deaths.  Statisticians, epidemiologists, economists, and data scientists have used this granular data to forecast COVID-19 case-counts, deaths, and hospitalizations~\cite{Giordano2020,Song2020,Ray2020,2020.IHME,Wang2020.03,JTD36385}.

The goal of this paper is to express reservations at the use of case-counts as a proxy for disease prevalence and in estimation of standard epidemiological models for inference and forecasting.  The reason is straightforward: observed case-count data is plagued by selection bias and measurement error. Through simple calculations, we will demonstrate that the information gained from increasing testing capacity is limited in the presence of selection bias and when testing inaccuracies persist.

% \subsection{Outline}

% This article discusses the relationship between three statistical concepts: selection bias, measurement error, and the too often forgotten population size. We clarify mathematically why the situation is much more complex than it first appears.  Through simple mathematical arguments, we clarify five important issues related to COVID-19 case-count analysis.  First, we show that unadjusted prevalence rates are (unsurprisingly) biased when tests are imperfect. What is surprising is that the direction and magnitude of the bias can vary substantially and interacts with the sampling fraction.  Next we show that data quality for adjusted prevalence rates includes an additional term in the error decomposition that captures the interplay among measurement error, selection bias, and prevalence.  Third, we show that daily trends in rate of positive tests is equally problematic even if testing rates and selection protocols are held constant.  We show that the rate of change in COVID-19 observed case-counts overestimates the true rate of change prior to the peak time and underestimates it immediately after.  This implies a data scientist analyzing observed rates will be (on average) overly pessimistic in the early stages of the pandemic, and overly optimistic subsequent to the peak times.  We show that estimates of the effective reproduction number may be similarly impacted.  Fourth, we show that cross-country comparisons are difficult at best with population size, sampling fraction, and data quality all interacting to impact null hypothesis testing.  Fifth, we discuss a sensitivity analysis method for estimating data quality and its use in understanding the potential biases in COVID-19 case-count analyses.  We then end the paper with a discussion of the benefits of randomized testing and use of auxiliary information to improve over simple random sampling.

\section{Analysis of case-count data}
\label{section:casecount}

We start with some simple notation.  Let $N$ denote the population size.  For state-level analysis $N$ is the state's total population, while for country-level analysis $N$ is the country's total population.  At a fixed moment in time, let $Y_j$ denote COVID-19 status for the $j$th individual in the population, $j=1,\ldots, N$. Here, like in survey methodology~\citep{Cochran77}, we treat COVID-19 status as a fixed but unknown quantity of interest. For simplicity, the dynamic nature of the outbreak and recoverability of individuals are initially ignored.  We assume either individual $j$ is COVID-19 positive and $Y_j=1$ or is COVID-19 negative and $Y_j=0$. We also let $I_j \in \{0,1\}$ be an indicator that the individual was selected for testing ($I = 1$) or not ($I=0$).

To start, we assume the primary questions of interest are estimates of the overall number of COVID-19 cases and/or disease prevalence. That is, we are interested in either the population total $Y = \sum_{j=1}^N Y_j$ or the population average $\bar Y = Y/N$. Suppose that $n$ tests are performed and we observe the values $y_1, \ldots, y_n \in \{0,1\}$.  Then a natural candidate for prevalence is the proportion of positive tests $\bar y = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n y_i$, and a natural candidate for overall cases is $N \times \bar y$.
Under simple random sampling (SRS) or any other epsem\footnote{equal probability of selection method} design, the above are unbiased estimators of the population-level quantities of interest.  Under SRS, the variance of the estimator can be expressed as $\frac{1}{N-1} \times \frac{1-f}{f} \times \sigma_Y^2$ where $f = n/N$ is the sampling fraction and $\sigma_Y^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (Y_i - \bar Y)^2 = \bar Y (1- \bar Y)$.

The above selection mechanisms are random and independent of the outcome of interest. When this is not the case, selection effects may cause bias in the above estimates. To better understand this issue, \cite{Meng2018} provided the following intuitive and powerful statistical decomposition of the error between $\bar y$ and the true proportion $\bar Y$
$$
\bar y_n - \bar Y =  \rho_{I, Y} \times \sqrt{\frac{1-f}{f}} \times \sigma_Y.
$$
The first term represents \emph{data quality}, the second \emph{data quantity}, and the third \emph{problem difficulty}. The term $\rho_{I,Y}$ is the empirical correlation between the population values~$\{ Y_j \}_{j=1}^N$ and the selection values $\{ I_j \}_{j=1}^N$.  Under simple random sampling, $E_{\I} [ \rho_{I,Y} ] = 0$, where the expectation is with respect to the selection mechanism~$\I$, so there is no bias.  The SRS variance formula above shows that $E_{\I} [ \rho_{I,Y}^2 ]  = 1/(N-1)$.  The key issue with selective testing is that $E_{\I} [ \rho_{I,Y} ] \neq 0$.  Meng identified this as the fundamental issue that can lead to paradoxes in the analysis of big data.

The remainder of this paper aims to build upon this fundamental work by extending the decomposition in two directions: accounting for measurement error and the temporal nature of the pandemic.  We then discuss effective sampling methods and their importance in the current pandemic.

\subsection{Imperfect testing}

Tests are imperfect.  COVID-19 testing is no exception. Here we investigate the interplay between imperfect testing and selection bias.  In discussions of inaccurate testing, the standard assumption is measurement error leads to parameter attenuation.  When paired with selection bias, however, the two sources of error become entangled, and resulting errors can become magnified, muted, or even switch signs.

First we require some additional notation.  Let $P_j$ be an indicator of measurement error, equal to $1$ when we incorrectly measure the outcome and $0$ when we observe the true outcome. We suppose this is a stochastic variable where $\pr(P_j = 1 \mid Y_j = 1) =: FN$ is the false-negative rate and $\pr(P_j = 1 \mid Y_j = 0) =: FP$ is the false-positive rate.  If individual $j$ is selected (i.e., $I_j = 1$) then the observed outcome can be written as $Y_j^{\star} = Y_j(1-P_j) + (1-Y_j) P_j$.  Suppose disease prevalence was estimated as the fraction who tested positive for COVID-19, i.e., $\bar y_n^\star = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N I_j Y_j^\star}{\sum_{i=1}^N I_j}$.  We can again investigate the error compared to the true prevalence $\bar Y$ in statistical terms:
$$
\bar y_n^\star - \bar Y = \sqrt{\frac{1-f}{f}} \left[ \rho_{I,Y} \times \sigma_Y + \rho_{I,PZ} \times \sigma_{PZ} + \sqrt{\frac{f}{1-f}}  \left( FP - (FP+FN) \bar Y \right) \right] .
$$
where $Z = 1-2Y$; see Appendix~\ref{app:imperfect} for the derivation. The first term in the large brackets represents the perfect testing regime; to this end, we refer to $\rho_{I,Y}$ as the \emph{true data quality}.  The second term represents the interaction between imperfect testing and selection bias. The variable $PZ = 1[Y=0,P=1] - 1[Y=1, P=1]$ is non-zero only when $P=1$ (i.e., the outcome is incorrectly reported); to this end, we refer to $\rho_{I,PZ}$ as the \emph{observed data quality} that accounts for both selection bias and measurement error.  In the appendix, we show the sign of $\rho_{I,PZ}$ is the opposite of the sign of $\rho_{I,Y}$, which implies that the observed data quality adds error in the opposite direction from the true data quality.  Finally, the third term represents the bias due to imperfect testing.

\subsubsection{Connecting true and observed data quality}

We start by considering the first two terms and assess whether the sign of the bias can reverse due to the interaction of measurement error and selection bias.  To do this, we define the sampling rates differential.  Let $f_1 := \pr (I_J = 1 \mid Y_J = 1)$ and $f_0 := \pr(I_J = 1 \mid Y_J = 0)$ be the sampling rates.  Then $\Delta = f_1 - f_0$ is the sampling rate differential.  Using these terms, we can re-express the first two terms as
$$
\rho_{I,Y} \times \sigma_Y + \rho_{I,PZ} \times \sigma_{PZ} =
\rho_{I,Y} \times \sigma_Y \left[ 1 - \Delta \times \frac{\bar Y}{1-\bar Y} \times \frac{FP(1-\bar Y) + FN \cdot \bar Y}{f_0 (1-\bar Y) + f_1 \bar Y} \right].
$$
The final term in brackets is the \emph{measurement error adjustment to data quality} which is a complex function of sampling rate differential, the odds ratio, and the ratio of measurement error interaction with prevalence and sampling rates interaction with prevalence. Note $\sgn(\Delta) = \sgn(\rho_{I,Y})$ by equation~\ref{eq:binaryrho} in the appendix, which implies the measurement error adjustment either shrinks the data quality measure toward zero or reverses its sign.

% While prior investigations have noted the interaction between measurement error and selection bias~\citep{Beesley2020,Beesley2019,Smeden2019}, the interaction with the sample size relative to the population, i.e., $f$, has largely been ignored.  The above statistical decomposition clarifies the importance of this quantity~$f$.  In particular, note that the statistical error also includes a bias term due to measurement error and this term increases as the sampled fraction $f$ increases. Therefore, how the first two terms interact with the final term depends on the fraction of the population sampled.  This interaction is complex, but implies that whether the estimate $\bar y^\star_n$ is an overestimate or underestimate is a complicated question due to the relation amongst these three pieces.

% Consider again the current COVID-19 pandemic. For now, we continue to assume the ratio of conditional selection rates $f_1/f_0$ is equal to 1.5.  In Section~\ref{section:est_dq}, we discuss recent research suggesting a false negative rate around 17.2\% and a false positive rate around 0.05\%. Under these rates and the current US prevalence rates, the ratio of the MSE to MSE under no measurement error is 0.436; if we switch false negative rates down to 5\% and increase the false positive rate to 5\% then the relative MSE is 2.89.  This is merely to demonstrate that in some cases we see a huge increase in MSE and in other settings we have a huge decrease in MSE.  What drives this is the false positive and negative rate interaction with prevalence and sampling rates.  Therefore, whether we are better or worse off with respect to the MSE is a very difficult question to answer.

\subsection{Deriving an unbiased estimator}

The attentive data analyst will recognize the estimator $\bar y_n$ is biased even for simple random samples and, if sensitivity and specificity were known a priori, may use the error decomposition to construct an unbiased estimator $\tilde y_n$.

In this paper, we consider the estimator $\tilde y_n = (\bar y_n - FP)/(1-(FP+FN))$ where $\bar y_n = n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n y_i$ is the proportion of positive tests in the sample. This estimator is unbiased under simple random sampling (SRS); see the supplementary materials for a derivation and discussion of the proposed estimator. To understand the impact of selection bias and imperfect testing, we derive the following statistical decomposition of the error between $\tilde y_n$ and $\bar Y$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:error}
\rho_{I,Y} \times \sqrt{\frac{1-f}{f}} \times \sigma_{Y}
\times \underbrace{\left[ 1 - \Delta \times \frac{\bar Y}{1-\bar Y} \times \frac{FP(1-\bar Y) + FN \cdot \bar Y}{f_0 (1-\bar Y) + f_1 \bar Y} \right] \times \frac{1}{1-(FP+FN)}}_{D_M},
\end{equation}
where $f=n/N$ is the sampling fraction, $f_1=n_1/N_1$ and $f_0=n_0/N_0=(n-n_1)/(N-N_1)$ are sampling fractions for COVID-19 positive and negative individuals respectively, and $\Delta = f_1 - f_0$ is the sampling rate differential.  See the supplementary materials for the derivation. This extends work by \cite{Meng2018} to account for imperfect testing. The first term represents \emph{data quality}, the second \emph{data quantity}, and the third \emph{problem difficulty}.  The final term represents the \emph{imperfect testing adjustment} which is a complex function of the sampling rate differential, the odds ratio, and the ratio of measurement error interaction with prevalence and sampling rates interaction with prevalence. Figure~\ref{fig:heatmap} shows that $D_M$, as a function of the relative frequency ($f_1/f_0$) and odds ratio, can be both positive and negative as well as a range of magnitudes~\cite{Beesley2020,Beesley2019,Smeden2019}. Under perfect testing, $D_M = 1$ so the relation between estimation and selection bias is simple, e.g., COVID-19 positive individuals more likely to receive test implies upward bias in prevalence estimates. When tests are imperfect, this simple relationship no longer holds.

Comparing the mean-squared error (MSE) under a selection mechanism $\I$ with imperfect testing and SRS with perfect testing, we see that
$$
\frac{E_{\I} \left[ (\bar y_n - \bar Y)^2 \right]}{\sqrt{V_{SRS} (\bar Y)}} = (N-1) E_{\I} \left[ \rho_{I,Y}^2 D_M^2 \right]
$$
implying the error relative to SRS increases as a function of population size~\cite{Meng2018}. The paradox that two countries with the same testing strategy can yield wildly different estimates due to population size is too often ignored in current communications of case-count data.  When comparing the US and UK under the assumption of similar testing strategies, for example, the MSE increases by a factor of five.  Thus, conclusions drawn from observed case-counts may not just be wrong, but very wrong.

\label{fig:heatmap}
\vspace{-0.3cm}
\end{wrapfigure}

A key question is ``What is the (effective) sample size from a SRS with perfect testing that would yield equivalent MSE to the current testing strategy?'' In the supplement, we show the effective sample size $n_{eff}$ can be bounded by
$$
\frac{f}{1-f} \times \frac{1}{E_{\I} \left[ \rho_{I,Y}^2 D_M^2 \right]}.
$$
As of June 10th, the US has performed $21,474,531$ tests.  The US population is roughly $312$ million, so $f = 0.069$.  The cumulative empirical prevalence is $9.3\%$ on May 8th. A recent study estimates a false positive and negative rate for antibody testing at $0.5$\% and $17.2$\% respectively \cite{Bendavid2020}. Supposing COVID-19 positive individuals are $2$ times more likely to get tested, then the effective sample size is $92$.  Recent proposals~\cite{Siddarth2020} have argued for increased testing capacity, which may likely reduce the relative sampling rate.  If the relative sampling rate drops to $1.2$ then the effective sample size will increase to $1950$.  Thus the effective sample size even in optimistic scenarios is equivalent to a small random sample from the population.  Moreover, increased testing capacity may also come at the cost of increases in false positive and negative rates.  Consider the case where $f$ increases from $0.05$ to $0.1$ and the increase is associated with the false negative rate rising from $5\%$ to $20$\%.  Then the effective sample size increases by a factor of $1.76$ rather than the expected $4$ fold increase.

\subsection{Regrettable rates: complex biases resulting from self-selection}
\label{section:rates}

The prior analysis demonstrates the limited information regarding COVID-19 prevalence in observational case-count data.  Scientists, however, may claim that daily observed case-counts simply undercount daily total cases by a constant multiple over time.  If true then the ratio of case-counts at consecutive times may be a good estimate of the true change in prevalence, helping scientists understand the disease trajectory.  In this section, we demonstrate how selection bias and imperfect testing impact such estimates.

Let $\bar Y_{t-1}$ and $\bar Y_{t}$ denote the prevalence on two consecutive days and consider the estimator $r = \tilde y_t / \tilde y_{t-1}$.  Using a second-order Taylor series approximation, the error between ${\tilde y_t}/{\tilde y_{t-1}}$ and ${\bar Y_{t}}/{\bar Y_{t-1}}$ can be expressed approximately as
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\bar Y_t}{\bar Y_{t-1}} &\times \bigg[ \rho_{I_t,Y_t} D_{M_t} \sqrt{\frac{1-f_t}{f_t}} CV (Y_t)  -\rho_{I_{t-1},Y_{t-1}} D_{M_{t-1}} \sqrt{\frac{1-f_{t-1}}{f_{t-1}}} CV (Y_{t-1}) \bigg] \\
&\times \left[ 1 - \rho_{I_{t-1},Y_{t-1}} D_{M_{t-1}} \sqrt{\frac{1-f_{t-1}}{f_{t-1}}} CV (Y_{t-1}) \right]
\end{aligned}
$$
where $\rho_{I_j, Y_j}$ is the data quality, $f_j$ is the sampling fraction, $D_{M_j}$ is the measurement error adjustment, and $CV(Y_j) = \sigma_{Y_j}/Y_j$ is the coefficient of variation on day $j$.  See the supplementary materials for the derivation. The error magnitude depends on the true rate $\bar Y_{t} / \bar Y_{t-1}$ so a large decrease will have a relatively small error compared to a large increase. The second term represents potential \emph{cancellation} which may occur when data quality, sampling fraction, measurement error, and prevalence are all constant across time.

Figure~\ref{fig:ratio-bias} displays the trajectory of the true ratio and the potential biased estimators under an SIR model~\cite{Pastor2001,Newman2002,Parshani2010} for the epidemic dynamics, with state evolution given by
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial S_t}{\partial t} &= - \beta S_t I_t N^{-1}; \quad
\frac{\partial I_t}{\partial t} = \beta S_t I_t N^{-1} - \gamma I_t; \quad
\frac{\partial R_t}{\partial t} = - \gamma I_t \\
\end{aligned}
$$
where $S_t$ is the number of susceptible individuals, $I_t$ is the number of infected individuals, and $R_t$ is the number of removed (recovered or deceased) individuals at time $t$.  In terms of bias, the rate is overestimated prior to the peak and underestimated afterwards; the bias increases dramatically when the relative fraction exceeds $2$.  From a decision making perspective, such biases have a substantial impact.  First, the overestimation may give lawmakers and governors more leverage in proposing aggressive actions that reduce prevalence.  Of course, the analysis supports the argument that the estimates based on available data may be pessimistic. What is missing in the current public health discourse is that the bias direction of the prevalence estimate is non-constant over time.   Underestimation post-peak puts pressure on lawmakers and governors to prematurely relax social distancing measures.  Moreover, it appears that the peak time is the easiest to estimate in terms of having minimal error using available data.  Note, however, that the standard errors will be large due to small effective sample sizes.

\subsection{Estimation of effective reproduction number}
\label{section:r0-estimation}
Many epidemiologists argue that tracking the effective reproduction number $R_t$ is the only way to manage through the crisis~\cite{Gabriel2020}.  Under a Poisson likelihood, a simple relation between the trajectory of new cases and the effective reproduction number can be derived \cite{Bettencourt2008}.  In particular, under an SIR model the number of case counts on day $t$, denoted $K_t$, is Poisson distributed with rate $K_{t-1} \exp \left( \gamma (R_t - 1) \right)$ where $K_{t-1} = Y_{t-1}-Y_{t-2}$ is the number of new cases on day $t-1$ and $\gamma$ is the serial interval, which is approximately $7$ days for COVID-19~\cite{Sanche2020}.  Using this relation, a moment-based estimator is given by
$$
R_t = 1 + \frac{1}{\gamma} \log \left( \frac{K_t}{K_{t-1}} \right).
$$
Of course, we do not observe $K_t$ and $K_{t-1}$.  Under SRS of new cases among those susceptible on day $t$, the natural estimator is $S_t \tilde y_t$.  Unfortunately the number of susceptible individuals on day $t$ is unknown.  Here, we study the estimator $\hat R_t = 1 + \frac{1}{\gamma} \log \left( \tilde y_t / \tilde y_{t-1} \right)$. We can again express the statistical error of $\hat R_t - R_t$ in useful terms as follows
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{\gamma}\log &\bigg( 1 + \bigg[ \rho_{I_t,K_t} D_{M_t} \sqrt{\frac{1-f_t}{f_t}} CV (K_t)  -\rho_{I_{t-1},K_{t-1}} D_{M_{t-1}} \sqrt{\frac{1-f_{t-1}}{f_{t-1}}} CV (K_{t-1}) \bigg] \\
&\times \left[ 1 - \rho_{I_{t-1},K_{t-1}} D_{M_{t-1}} \sqrt{\frac{1-f_{t-1}}{f_{t-1}}} CV (K_{t-1}) \right] \bigg) - \frac{1}{\gamma} \log \left( \frac{S_t}{S_{t-1}} \right).
\end{aligned}
$$
This implies a similar trade-off as before but on the logarithmic scale.  The error is no longer scaled by $\bar Y_t/\bar Y_{t-1}$ but by the serial interval and does not depend on prevalence $\bar Y_t$ but on the fraction of new cases out of those susceptible $\bar K_t$. This leads to differences in when the bias is most pronounced. The final term is the error due to varying numbers of susceptible individuals.  Figure~\ref{fig:r0-bias} displays the bias as a function of the relative sampling fraction assuming the fraction of the population that is susceptible remains large.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Effect modifiers in COVID-19 clinical trials}

Here we show how selection bias and measurement error can creep into clinical trial analysis. The key concern is whether clinical trials on COVID-19 recruit from the pool of individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 or whether they sample randomly from the population, test, and then recruit from this subset of tested individuals.  To see this issue, suppose we have an outcome $Y$, a treatment $A$ and an \emph{unobserved} variable $U$.  Suppose treatment is assigned at random, i.e., $A =1$ with probability $50\%$ and $A=0$ with probability $50\%$.  Suppose the conditional mean of the outcome satisfies  $E(Y \mid U, A ) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 A + \beta_2 U + \beta_3 A U$.  Typically, we are interested in the \emph{causal effect} of $A$ on $Y$.  In counterfactual language,
$$
E( Y(A=1) - Y(A=0) ) = E_U ( E_A ( Y(A=1) - Y(A=0) \mid U=u ))
= \beta_1 + \beta_3 E(U).
$$
Even in a randomized experiment, the question is what the correct value for $E(U)$ is. For COVID-19, the value of interest is the expected value of $U$ in the population of COVID-19 positive individuals.  Due to selection bias, however, the bias in this marginal treatment effect compared to the true marginal effect of interest is $\beta_1 \cdot E_{\I} [ \rho_{I,U} ] \times \sqrt{ \frac{f}{1-f} } \times \sigma_U$.  Selection bias then leads to the estimated effect being biased if $\beta_1 \neq 0$.  Directionality of the bias will depend on the relationship between $U$ and $Y$.  If $U$ is a measure of disease severity, then it could be expected to see $\beta_1 > 0$ and $E_{\I} [ \rho_{I, U} ] >0$.  In such situations, the treatment effect estimates will tend to be overly optimistic as most individuals recruited are potentially higher on the severity index than the population average.  Not only that, but for fixed data quality, the error compared to SRS in terms of effect estimation scales with the population size (i.e., the law of large populations).

Randomization of treatment assignment in clinical trials negates unobserved confounders.  This, however, does not negate effect modifiers.  Therefore, for marginal treatment effects to be interpretable, there must be a well-defined population.  Most often, our main interest is in causal effects on the population of COVID-19 positive.  Randomization within the clinical trial design yields internal validity, but we also need external validity to estimate the correct marginal effect of interest~\cite{Keiding2016}.

\section{Cross-population comparisons}
So far we have focused on understanding the limitations of using case-count data to understand population quantities of interest for a \emph{single} population.  Many are interested in cross-population comparisons to contrast the impact of countries' mitigation policies.  Many pieces in the media as well as academic articles have plots of case-count over time aligned by time of first known case.  Others have claimed such comparisons unfair due to unequal population sizes and instead plotted case-count per million.  In this section, we focus on the statistical issues relevant to such comparisons.

\subsection{Prevalence comparisons}

At a fixed time, suppose prevalence estimates $\bar y_1$ and $\bar y_2$ are observed for two populations. We can express $\bar y_1 - \bar y_2$ in statistical terms as
$$
(\bar Y_1 - \bar Y_2) + \left[ \rho_{I_1, Y_1} \times D_{M_1} \times \sqrt{\frac{1-f_1}{f_1}} \times \sigma_{Y_1}  - \rho_{I_2, Y_2} \times D_{M_2} \times \sqrt{\frac{1-f_2}{f_2}} \times \sigma_{Y_2} \right].
$$
The first term is the difference in population prevalence (i.e., the quantity of interest).  If random sampling were performed in each population, $E_{\I} [ \rho_{I_j, Y_j}] = 0$ and so the estimate would be unbiased.  However, the second term represents the complex error that results from selection bias.
The particular test of interest is $H_0: \bar Y_1 = \bar Y_2$.  Under the null, $\sigma_{Y_1} = \sigma_{Y_2}$.  In classical statistics, we would compute a Z-score:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\bar y_1 - \bar y_2}{ \sqrt{V_{SRS} (\bar y_1 - \bar y_2)} } &=
\frac{\rho_{I_1, Y_1} \times D_{M_1} \times \sqrt{\frac{1-f_1}{f_1}}  - \rho_{I_2, Y_2} \times D_{M_2} \times \sqrt{\frac{1-f_2}{f_2}} }{ \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_1 -1} \times \frac{1-f_1}{f_1} + \frac{1}{N_2 - 1} \times \frac{1-f_2}{f_2}} }  \\
&\overset{\star}{=}
\sqrt{\frac{(N_1-1)(N_2 -1)}{N_1 + N_2}} \left[ \rho_{I_1, Y_1} - \rho_{I_2, Y_2} \right]
\end{aligned}
$$
Where the last equality holds under $f_1 = f_2$, i.e., same sampling rate relative to population size. This tells us that the exact error in the comparison of sample means, as an estimate of the difference in population means, scales as a function of the difference in data quality $\rho_{I_1, Y_1} - \rho_{I_2, Y_2}$ times a square root of a population adjustment.  For highly unequal population sizes (e.g., $N_1 \gg N_2$), the adjustment is approximated well by the square root of the smaller population size minus one (e.g. $\sqrt{N_2 -1}$).

Take, for example, a comparison of the US and Canada.  The two population sizes are approximately 328 million and 38 million people.  Then the population adjustment is $5.84$ million. As of May 5th, Canada has performed a total of 24.92 tests per 1,000 people while the US has performed a total of 22.01 tests per 1,000 people\footnote{According to \href{https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand}{ourworldindata.org}} so the data quantities are approximately equal to $f = 23/1000 = 0.023$.  Then, under a prevalence of 10\%, one would need the differential $\Delta_1-\Delta_2$ to be much smaller than $11.68 \times 10^{-6}$ in order for the selection bias to not impact.  So only under the very strong assumptions of equal data quantity and quality will the comparisons be valid and the $Z$-score can be treated as in the classical setting.  A simple alternative is to use the effective sample sizes to build more appropriate $Z$-score.  That is, setting
$$
Z_n = \frac{\bar y_1 - \bar y_2}{ \frac{1-f}{f} \sigma_y \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n_{1,eff} - 1} + \frac{1}{n_{2,eff} - 1}}}
$$
allows us to build Z-scores that account for the true sample size.  While still not perfect, this allows us to build Z-scores that are not overly confident due to selection bias and measurement error.  See Section~\ref{section:est_dq} for discussion of how to estimate data quality.

\subsection{Rate comparisons}

An alternative is the comparison on the rates of case-count change over time.  Here, for simplicity, we focus on comparing the estimated effective reproductive rate.  We assume the two time-series are aligned so that $t=0$ is the time of first case.  This negates alignment issues and is common in practice.

While the above issues on $Z$-scores and effective sample size are important, here we highlight a separate issue.  Namely, the interaction of biases in estimation of the two trajectories when the peak infection times differ slightly.  We can write the difference in the rates as
$$
R_{t1} - R_{t2} = \frac{1}{\gamma} \log \left( \frac{1 + e_{1t}}{1+e_{2t}} \right)
$$
where $e_{jt}$ is the error associated given in Section \ref{section:r0-estimation}.  Recall that the error allowed for over-estimation prior to the peak and then under-estimation post-peak.  Here, these errors can mingle in interesting ways.  Consider two countries (A and B) in which the peak occurs 2 weeks prior for country A than country B.  Figure~\ref{fig:comparison} presents such a comparison where each country's disease trajectory follows an SIR model (A=black and B=red). Of interest is the difference between the effective reproduction rate for country A and B, $R_{tA} - R_{tB}$. Figure~\ref{fig:eff} shows how biases in estimation of each rate interact in complex ways.  At first, the difference is correctly estimated; then the gap is over-estimated as country A sees a rapid rise in cases; then the magnitude of over-estimation increases as country A sees declining case-count while country B sees rapidly increasing case-count; then country A's rate is correctly estimated while country B's rate is under-estimated as it sees declining case-count; finally, the gap disappears.  We do not claim this will always be the case; however, this demonstrates how observed information can tell a more complex story than the truth (i.e., country A's peak is 2 weeks prior to country B's peak).

\subsection{Estimation of Data Quality}
\label{section:est_dq}

We next consider estimation of data quality $E_{\I} \left[ \rho_{I,Y} \right]$. In \cite{Meng2018}, estimation relied on observing the true outcome (i.e., election vote totals), which  is not possible in the current crisis.  Here, we propose using surveys as noisy but unbiased estimates of the true prevalence. Our goal is not inferential. Instead, we aim to build sensitivity analyses that can aid in understanding the amount of information in observational COVID case-count data.

On April 23rd, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced results from a study in New York state.  It found 13.9\% of 3,000 people tested across the state had signs of the virus.  The study did not report sensitivity and specificity; therefore, we take reported measures from the Santa Clara study~\cite{Bendavid2020}.  The reported specificity is $82.8\%$ (95\% CI: 76.0-88.4\%) and sensitivity is $99.5\%$ (95\% CI: 99.2-99.7\%).  This corresponds to a false negative rate of $17.2\%$ (11.6-24.0\%) and false positive rate of $0.5\%$ (0.3 - 0.8\%).  The estimated prevalence is then $16.3\%$ with a range of 15.0\% to 18.0\%. For simplicity, we assume the study was conducted on April 20th. On the 20th, $19,654$ tests were performed. The population of New York is $19,378,102$.   Subtracting off the $617,555$ tests that had already performed yields a sampling fraction of $f = 0.001$.  The smoothed prevalence estimate is 28.4\%.  Adjusting for imperfect testing yields an estimate of $33.9\%$.

Under the assumption that the survey is a SRS from New York, the error is $17.6$\%.  Using~\eqref{eq:error}, we construct an estimate of the relative sampling rate as follows
\[
\rho D_M = \sqrt{\frac{f}{1-f}} \frac{\text{0.176}}{\sigma_Y} = 1.07 \times 10^{-2} \Rightarrow \Delta = 1.07 \times 10^{-3} \Rightarrow M = 2.3.
\]
We can perform a sensitivity analysis by considering the range of false negative and positive rates from~\cite{Bendavid2020}, which leads to a range for $M$ of $(2.21, 2.38)$.  Therefore, the impact on bias of $\hat R_t$ appears moderate.  If $FP = 0.05$ and $FN = 0.005$, then the relative sampling rate increases to $M=3.04$.  This simple tool helps us understand how sensitivity and specificity impact biases and  therefore how much we should trust conclusions based on these assumptions.

\section{Discussion.}
There is nothing routine about COVID-19, including the corresponding statistical questions.  The goal of this paper was to point out questionable statistical routines.  The precision in reported case-count data gives the illusion of information when what what is needed is quantification of uncertainty. Selection bias leads data analysts to feel certain about incorrect conclusions.  We end with a brief discussion of important related topics.

\subsection*{Decision-making: data versus information}

Having read through the above technical discussions, one may come to the incorrect conclusion that because we are concerned about implicit biases in observational data, we must wait for better data sources in order to act~\citep{Ioannidis2020}.  This conclusion confuses data and information.  Lack of high quality data means we should be skeptical regarding conclusions drawn from these data sources alone.  Being skeptical of observed data does not imply governments and communities should wait for high quality data to act; this is especially true in the current high risk scenario.  Instead, we should aim to have high quality information.  Yet in the current crisis we have just that.  Indeed, epidemiologists and public health officials have a strong understanding of the basic facts of pandemics and disease spread.  Social distancing, contact tracing and mass testing are all important.  Individuals and communities with low quality data and only basic information will hopefully make decisions that respect inherent risks to their well being as well as the high degree of uncertainty in the observed data. Of course, there are trade-offs and long-term stay-at-home orders will have negative economic consequences.  A full discussion of these topics is beyond the scope of the current article.

\subsection*{Data quantity versus quality}

Governments implicitly argue that increased testing capacity will perform the above task.  Without complete compliance, however, our understanding of future outbreaks may be plagued by self-selection bias, compounded by changing sensitivity and specificity rates. Random testing removes these effect modifiers, giving governments more information to fight the disease.  This is not to say random testing should replace current testing practices; only that the random testing should supplement and will provide valuable additional information even with moderate sample sizes.

\subsection*{High quality information on prevalence.}

Governments are pushing for increased testing capacity and robust contact tracing.  Contact tracing is incredibly useful for identifying carriers early and preventing spread of the disease.  We would argue that, after the current wave, understanding prevalence is also key.  We know that the probability of an outbreak is a function of current prevalence and network connectivity.  Epidemic critical thresholds have been derived for many infectious disease models~\cite{Pastor2001,Newman2002,Parshani2010}.  Knowing prevalence will help governments determine long-term community-level risk and allow for more targeted interventions -- shutting down only certain locations when necessary.

\subsection*{Stratified sampling: improving precision in low-prevalence environments.}
Random sampling is a powerful tool.  One difficulty with SRS is when prevalence is low.  Consider the Santa Clara study~\cite{Bendavid2020} which estimated prevalence less than 2\% in the county.  The key issue with low prevalence is that if the test's specificity is higher than the prevalence, then the observed data is consistent with zero recovered individuals. In these settings, SRS is likely to fail; however, there are potential solutions.  One can, for example, stratify the population into risk categories (e.g., based on population density, occupation, age) and perform Neyman allocation~\cite{Cochran77}.

\paragraph*{Model-based solutions.}

One can extend the SIR model to account for selection bias and measurement error. Without strong assumptions on the selection mechanism, however, the estimates are often not identifiable.  When an issue ``cannot be resolved nonparametrically then it is usually dangerous to resolve it parametrically''\cite{CoxHink74}. Absent random sampling, the best route forward for all data analyses is careful associated sensitivity analyses and humility in data-driven conclusions.

\section{Imperfect testing: derivation}
\label{app:imperfect}
We considered the mean estimator
$$
\bar y_n^\star = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^N Y_j^\star I_j}{\sum_{j=1}^N I_j} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N  I_j Y_j^\star }{\sum_{j=1}^N  I_j } = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N  I_j \left[ Y_j (1-P_j) + (1-Y_j) P_j \right]}{\sum_{j=1}^N  I_j }
$$
For any set of numbers $\{ A_1, \ldots, A_N \}$ we can view it as the support of a random variable $A_J$ induced by the random index $J$ defined on $\{1,\ldots, N\}$.  When $J$ is uniformly distributed $E_J (A_J) = \sum_{j=1}^N A_j / N \equiv \bar A_N$. Then
$$
\begin{aligned}
\bar y_n^\star  - \bar Y_N &= \frac{E_J \left[ I_J \left[ Y_J (1-P_J) + (1-Y_J) P_J \right] \right]}{E_J [ I_J ] } - E_J[Y_J] \\
&= \frac{E_J \left[ I_J P_J (1-2Y_J) \right]}{E_J [ I_J ] } + \left( \frac{E_J [I_J Y_J]}{E_J [ I_J ] } - \frac{E_J[Y_J] E_J[I_J]}{E_J[I_J]} \right) \\
\end{aligned}
$$
The term in parentheses can be re-written as
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{E_J [I_J Y_J]- E_J[Y_J] E_J[I_J]}{E_J[I_J]} &=  \frac{E_J [I_J Y_J]- E_J[Y_J] E_J[I_J]}{\sqrt{V_J(I_J) V_J(Y_J)}} \frac{\sqrt{V_J(I_J)}}{E_J[I_J]} \times \sqrt{V_J(Y_J)} \\
&= \rho_{I,Y} \times \sqrt{\frac{(1-f)}{f}} \times \sigma_Y
\end{aligned}
$$
which agrees with Meng's (2019) decomposition. For the other term, first we define $Z_j := 1 - 2 Y_j $. Then $Z_j = 1$ if $Y_j = 0$ and $Z_j = -1$ if $Y_j = 1$. Then the term can be re-written as
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{E_J \left[ I_J P_J (1-2Y_J) \right]}{E_J [ I_J ] } &= \left( \frac{E_J \left[ I_J P_J Z_J \right]}{E_J [ I_J ] } -  \frac{E_J \left[ P_J Z_J \right] E_J[ I_J]}{E_J [ I_J ] } \right) +  \frac{E_J \left[ P_J Z_J \right] E_J[ I_J]}{E_J [ I_J ] } \\
\end{aligned}
$$
The term in parentheses can be re-expressed using the previous technique as:
$$
\rho_{I, PZ} \times \sqrt{\frac{1-f}{f}} \times \sigma_{PZ}
$$
where now the ``data defect'' and ``problem difficulty'' are with respect to $PZ$ rather than $Y$. The final term is equal to
$$
\begin{aligned}
E_J [P_J Z_J ] &= E_J [ E_J [ P_J Z_J \mid Y_J ] ] \\
&= \pr (P = 1 \mid Y = 0) (1-\bar Y) - \pr(P=1 \mid Y = 1) \bar Y \\
&= FP - (FP + FN) \cdot \bar Y
\end{aligned}
$$
Combining these yields:
$$
\bar y_n^\star - \bar Y = \sqrt{\frac{1-f}{f}} \left[\rho_{I,Y} \sigma_Y + \rho_{I, PZ} \sigma_{PZ} + \sqrt{\frac{f}{1-f}} \left( FP - (FP+FN) \bar Y \right) \right]
$$
For the binary outcome $Y$, we have $\sigma_Y = \sqrt{\bar Y (1-\bar Y)}$. Moreover,
$$
\begin{aligned}
V_J(P_J Z_J) &= E_J[(P_J Z_J)^2] - E[P] E[Z] \\
&= E[P] - E[P] (1 - 2 \bar Y) = 2 \bar Y E_J [ P_J ] \\
&= 2 \bar Y \left( FP (1-\bar Y) + FN \bar Y \right) \\
\Rightarrow \sigma_{PZ} &= \sqrt{ 2 \bar Y \left( FP (1-\bar Y) + FN \cdot  \bar Y \right) }
\end{aligned}
$$
Then the formula for the error is given by:
$$
\sqrt{\frac{1-f}{f}} \left[\rho_{I,Y} \sqrt{\bar Y (1-\bar Y)} + \rho_{I, PZ} \sqrt{ 2 \bar Y \left( FP (1-\bar Y) + FN \cdot \bar Y \right )} + \sqrt{\frac{f}{1-f}} \left( FP - (FP+FN) \bar Y \right) \right]
$$

\subsection{Estimate of observed data quality}

By definition, we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
\rho_{I,PZ} &= \frac{C(I, PZ)}{\sqrt{V(PZ) V(I)}} \\
&= \frac{C(I, PZ)}{\sqrt{V(Y) V(I)}} \sqrt{\frac{V(Y)}{V(PZ)}} \\
&= \rho_{I,Y} \frac{C(I,PZ)}{C(I,Y)} \sqrt{ \frac{(1-\bar Y)}{2 ( FP (1-\bar Y) + FN \cdot \bar Y)} }
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
C(I, PZ) &= E[ I P Z ] - E[I] E[PZ] \\
&=  [FP f_0 - (FP f_0 + FN f_1) \bar Y] - f [ FP - (FP+FN) \bar Y ] \\
&=  - FP \Delta \bar Y + FP \bar Y^2 \Delta - FN \bar Y^2 \Delta \\
&=  - \Delta \bar Y (FP \cdot (1-\bar Y) + FN \cdot \bar Y) \\
\end{aligned}
$$
where $f = f_1 \bar Y + f_0 (1-\bar Y)$ so $f_0 - f = -\Delta \bar Y$ and $f_1 - f = \Delta (1-\bar Y)$.
$$
\begin{aligned}
C(I, Y) &= E[ I Y ] - f \bar Y \\
&=  f_1 \bar Y + f_0 (1-\bar Y) - f \bar Y \\
&=  f_0 (1-\bar Y) + \Delta (1-\bar Y) \bar Y \\
&= (1-\bar Y) (f_0 + \Delta \bar Y)
\end{aligned}
$$
Combining yields
$$
\begin{aligned}
\rho_{I,PZ} &= \rho_{I,Y} \times \frac{- \Delta \bar Y (FP \cdot (1-\bar Y) + FN \cdot \bar Y) }{(1-\bar Y) (f_0 + \Delta \bar Y)} \times \sqrt{ \frac{(1-\bar Y)}{2 ( FP (1-\bar Y) + FN \cdot \bar Y)} } \\
&= - \rho_{I, Y} \times \Delta \times \sqrt{\frac{\bar Y}{1-\bar Y}} \frac{\sqrt{FP(1-\bar Y) + FN \cdot \bar Y}}{f_0 (1-\bar Y) + f_1 \bar Y} \times \sqrt{\frac{\bar Y}{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$
We can then re-write $\rho_{I,Y} \sigma_Y + \rho_{I,PZ} \sigma_{PZ}$ as
$$
\rho_{I,Y} \sigma_Y \left( 1 - \Delta \times \frac{\bar Y}{1-\bar Y} \times \frac{FP(1-\bar Y) + FN \cdot \bar Y}{f_0 (1-\bar Y) + f_1 \bar Y} \right)
$$
Suppose $f_1 = M \cdot f_0$.  Then $\Delta = f_1 - f_0 = f_0 (M-1)$ and $f_0 (1-\bar Y) + f_1 \bar Y = f_0 ( (1-\bar Y) + M \bar Y )$ and we can re-write above as
$$
\rho_{I,Y} \sigma_Y \left( 1 - (M-1) \times \frac{\bar Y}{1-\bar Y} \times \frac{FP(1-\bar Y) + FN \cdot \bar Y}{(1-\bar Y) + M \bar Y} \right).
$$

\subsection{Ratio estimator}
\label{app:ratio}

Let ${\bf u} = (u_{t-1},u_t) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ and $g({\bf u}) = \frac{u_t}{u_{t-1}}$, i.e., a differentiable function $g:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$. Centering a Taylor series expansion of second-order around coordinates $(U_2, U_1) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ yields
$$
\begin{aligned}
g({\bf u}) =& g(U_{t-1}, U_t) - \frac{U_t}{U_{t-1}^2} (u_{t-1} - U_{t-1}) + \frac{1}{U_{t-1}} (u_t - U_t) \\
&+ \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{2 U_t}{U_{t-1}^3} (u_{t-1} - U_{t-1})^2 + 0 \times (u_t - U_t)^2 - 2 \times (u_{t-1} - U_{t-1}) (u_t - U_t) \frac{1}{U_t^2} \right]
\end{aligned}
$$
Plugging in $(\bar y_{t-1}, \bar y_t)$ for $(u_{t-1}, u_t)$ and $(\bar Y_{t-1}, \bar Y_t)$ for $(U_{t-1}, U_t)$ yields the $\frac{\bar y_t}{\bar y_{t-1}} - \frac{\bar Y_t}{\bar Y_{t-1}} $ is equal to
$$
\begin{aligned}
=&
- \frac{\bar Y_t}{\bar Y_{t-1}^2} (\bar y_{t-1} - \bar Y_{t-1}) + \frac{1}{\bar Y_{t-1}} (\bar y_t - \bar Y_t) \\
&+ \frac{\bar Y_t}{\bar Y_{t-1}^3} (\bar y_{t-1} - \bar Y_{t-1})^2 -  (\bar y_{t-1} - \bar Y_{t-1}) (\bar y_t - \bar Y_t) \frac{1}{\bar Y_{t-1}^2} \\
&= \frac{\bar Y_t}{\bar Y_{t-1}} \bigg[  \rho_{I_t,Y_t} \sqrt{\frac{1-f_t}{f_t}} CV (Y_t)  -\rho_{I_{t-1},Y_{t-1}} \sqrt{\frac{1-f_{t-1}}{f_{t-1}}} CV (Y_{t-1}) \\
&+ \rho^2_{I_{t-1},Y_{t-1}} \frac{1-f_{t-1}}{f_{t-1}} CV^2 (Y_{t-1}) -  \rho_{I_{t-1},Y_{t-1}} \sqrt{\frac{1-f_{t-1}}{f_{t-1}}} CV (Y_{t-1}) \times
\rho_{I_t,Y_t} \sqrt{\frac{1-f_t}{f_t}} CV (Y_t)   \bigg] \\
&= \frac{\bar Y_t}{\bar Y_{t-1}} \bigg[ \rho_{I_t,Y_t} \sqrt{\frac{1-f_t}{f_t}} CV (Y_t)  -\rho_{I_{t-1},Y_{t-1}} \sqrt{\frac{1-f_{t-1}}{f_{t-1}}} CV (Y_{t-1}) \bigg] \left[ 1 - \rho_{I_{t-1},Y_{t-1}} \sqrt{\frac{1-f_{t-1}}{f_{t-1}}} CV (Y_{t-1}) \right]
\end{aligned}
$$
where the second equality is obtained by plugging in the statistical decomposition of the error for both time points and the coefficient of variation being defined as $CV(Y) := \sigma_Y/\mu_Y$.  Under measurement error, the extra terms $D_{2}$ and $D_1$ can be inserted in the correct locations.

\subsection{Estimation of effective reproduction number}

Let
$$
\delta_t := \bigg[ \rho_{I_t,K_t} D_{M_t} \sqrt{\frac{1-f_t}{f_t}} CV (K_t)  -\rho_{I_{t-1},K_{t-1}} D_{M_{t-1}} \sqrt{\frac{1-f_t}{f_t}} CV (K_{t-1}) \bigg].
$$
Then results from Section~\ref{app:ratio} show that the estimate of the number of new cases on day t is given by
$$
\frac{S_t \cdot \bar y_t}{S_{t-1} \cdot \bar y_{t-1}} =
\frac{K_t}{K_{t-1}} \left( 1 + \delta_t \times \left[ 1 - \rho_{I_{t-1},K_{t-1}} D_{M_{t-1}} \sqrt{\frac{1-f_t}{f_t}} CV (K_{t-1}) \right] \right)
$$
Then setting $e_t = \delta_t \times [1 - \rho_{I_{t-1},K_{t-1}} D_{M_{t-1}} \sqrt{\frac{1-f_t}{f_t}} CV (K_{t-1}) ]$, we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
\log \left( \frac{S_t \bar y_t}{S_{t-1} \bar y_{t-1}} \right) - \log \left( \frac{K_t}{K_{t-1}} \right) &= \log (1 + e_t) \\
\log \left( \frac{\bar y_t}{\bar y_{t-1}} \right) - \log \left( \frac{K_t}{K_{t-1}} \right) &= 1 + e_t - \log \left( \frac{S_t}{S_{t-1}} \right) \\
1 + \frac{1}{\gamma} \log \left( \frac{\bar y_t}{\bar y_{t-1}} \right) - \left[ 1 + \frac{1}{\gamma} \log \left( \frac{K_t}{K_{t-1}} \right) \right] &= \frac{1}{\gamma} \left[ \log \left( 1 + e_t \right) - \log \left( \frac{S_{t}}{S_{t-1}} \right) \right] \\
\Rightarrow \hat R_t - R_t &= \frac{1}{\gamma} \left[ \log \left( 1 + e_t \right) - \log \left( \frac{S_{t}}{S_{t-1}} \right) \right]
\end{aligned}
$$



\section{Derivation for the effective sample size}
\label{section:effss}

For binary outcomes, we have
\begin{equation} \label{eq:binaryrho}
\rho_{I,Y} = \Delta \sqrt{\frac{\bar Y (1 - \bar Y)}{f (1-f)} }
\end{equation}
where $\Delta = P_J (I_J = 1 \mid Y_J = 1) - P(I_J = 1 \mid Y_J = 0) = f_1 - f_0$.  Suppose that $M = f_1/f_0$; then
$f_0 = f / (\bar Y \cdot (M-1) + 1)$.  For $\bar Y = 0.091$, $M = 2$ and $f = 0.026$ we have $f_0 = 0.024$ and $f_1 = 0.048$ which implies $\Delta = 0.024$.
Then $\rho_{I,Y} = 0.043$.  Then $E_{\I} [ \rho_{I,Y}^2 ] \leq (E_{\I} [\rho_{I,Y} ]^2 = 0.0019$.  Then
$$
n_{eff} \leq \frac{f}{1-f} \frac{1}{0.0019} = 14.39.
$$
Using this computation, we compute effective sample size under a range of values $\bary$, $M$ with $f = 0.026$ (i.e., current sampling fraction) and $f =1/7$ (sample individuals roughly every 7 days).

\begin{tabular}{rrrrrr}

$\bar y$ & 1.2 & 1.4 & 1.6 & 1.8 & 2 \\

We also present the same plot under $FP = 0.005$ and $FN = 0.172$ to show the impact of measurement error on effective sample size.

% I prefer to think of a statistical sensibility rather than statistical thinking. It’s “less than an agenda but more than an attitude.”  It allows for methodological preference while avoiding dogma. Paired with data analytic humility and I think you have proper “data science”


% A test of meaningfulness of a possible model for a data-generating process is whether it can be used directly to simulate data.” (p.104).  In our current setting, this most certainly related to simulation while accounting for measruement error.
